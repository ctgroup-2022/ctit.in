            <p align="justify"> 
            Electronics Engineering is one of the largest and fastest growing field of engineering. It covers a wide range of applications which make our life easier and enjoyable such as Television, Radio, computers, telecommunication etc. They help us to see, hear and communicate over vast distances and do things faster. Electronics has a major role in improving productivity in industries like oil, energy, agriculture and so many other important sectors of economy. In steel, petroleum and chemical industries it is the electronic devices that direct, control and test production processes. Health care industries depend on electronic instruments to perform chemical tests and to check body functions. <br>
            The safety in transportation, factories and mines and in homes relies heavily on electronics. An electronics engineer specializes to design, fabricate, produce, test and supervise the manufacture of complex products and systems i.e electronic equipments and components for a number of industries including hospitals, computer industry, electronic data processing systems for communication and in defense etc. They supervise production and manufacturing processes and oversee installation and maintenance. Electronics engineers work with devices that use extremely small amounts of power. They work with microprocessors, fibre optics, and in telecommunication, television, radio etc. These sought-after engineers can look forward to a rewarding and glorious career.

                <p align="justify">The department of ECE was established in the year 2004 with b.tech programme. The objectives for the establishment of the department are in line with the vision of CTIT to become an exemplary institute of nationally acknowledged stature and excellence in teaching, research and development. Furthermore, our academic program and learning environment have been designed to contribute to the quality and intellectual development of the students. We offer a wealth of opportunities for our faculty and students to contribute to a broad spectrum of research. Our faculty members make every effort to ensure that the students "learn how to learn" and how to become leaders and pioneers, emphasizing fundamental principles that respond to and create technological changes that challenge the exceptional ability of a ct student. The department gives exposure to its students, not only to the regular engineering curriculum but also to the aspirations of today's corporate world by inculcating a professional attitude in them. It also has a commitment for providing opportunities to students in diverse fields such as telecommunications, embedded systems etc. The programs are enriched by the variety of cultural, economic, and educational backgrounds of our students, faculty, and staff. The department also emphasizes on all round development of the faculty and laboratory staff by providing them conducive academic environment and necessary infrastructure for carrying out academic and research work.</p>
