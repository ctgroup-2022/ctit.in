            <p align="justify"> 
            The Department of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning represents a significant advancement that is rapidly changing a wide range of businesses. Businesses and other organizations going through a digital transformation are confronted with an expanding deluge of data that is both immensely valuable and getting more and harder to gather, manage, and analyze. To handle the enormous amount of data being gathered, mine it for insights, and act upon those insights once they are found, new tools and processes are required. The goal of the AI and ML area is to solve problems that corporations, governments, and regular people face. These solutions are now indispensable. Both educators and students acquire new skills, apply them, and develop applications that meet pressing needs.

The department offers a 4 year Bachelors of Technology program in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. Data engineers, automation and optimisation engineers, scientists in natural language processing, game developers, robotics professionals, research scientists, machine learning developers, AI consultants, and machine learning architects are just a few of the positions that artificial intelligence and machine learning have created for expert professionals in large organisations. We aim to offer the best curricular and co-curricular services possible through ongoing brainstorming exercises like coding competitions, seminars, workshops, and extended programmes, enabling our students to use their knowledge and benefit the business. The more general idea of machines being able to perform tasks in a manner that we would deem "smart" is known as artificial intelligence. The focus of AI ML is on the present applications of AI, with the underlying premise that machines should ideally be allowed to access data and learn on their own. The world is going to be affected by artificial intelligence more than by some of the most pervasive inventions in history.</p>

Instead of using a preset equation as a model, machine learning algorithms "learn" information directly from data using computational techniques. As the amount of samples available for learning grows, the algorithms perform better and better in an adaptive manner. Two methods are used in machine learning: unsupervised learning, which looks for innate structures or hidden patterns in input data, and supervised learning, which trains a model using known input and output data to predict future outputs. The lab provides software, hardware and Internet resources to conduct these high end tasks for the knowledge and skills of the students.</p>

AI technology is increasing efficiency and performance in businesses by automating procedures or jobs that previously needed human labour. Additionally, AI is able to interpret data at a scale beyond human comprehension. That ability can yield significant business advantages. Repetitive learning and data-driven discovery are automated by AI. Artificial Intelligence handles repetitive, high-volume, digital activities rather than automating manual ones. And it does so without growing weary.

                            The lab focuses on conducting practical assignments related to cloud computing and virtualization. Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage. The term ‘cloud computing’ also refers to the technology that makes cloud work. This includes some form of virtualized IT infrastructure—servers, operating system software, networking, and other infrastructure that’s abstracted, using special software, so that it can be pooled and divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries. For example, a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers.

The students of MBA were taken to Amritsar at Hanni Industries. The industry dealt in various export quality products. They manufacture many Indian spices, Jaggery and its related products. They also deal in Kesar exports. The countries in which they export their products are Canada, New Zealand, England and many others. Their 95% business is based on exports. The owner of the industry said that he got inspired from his mother’s illness and started manufacturing pure products. He worked as one-man army at the earliest stages of business and then over the years has transformed it into a full-fledged industry. The students have learned a lot in this visit and have given positive feedback and appreciated our prestigious institute for arranging such visits. </p>

Amudhavel University of Tartu, Estonia on 18 April 2023. Dr. Amudhavel briefed the students about the domains of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and how they are impacting everyday activities. He discussed the applications of AI and ML in social networks in creating content, segregating content and automation of office work. He discussed a few websites showcasing AI open-source projects for students. Students were interested in watching 3D and graphics generated by algorithms which are quite popular on various social media platforms. He shared certification courses and projects which students can take up and make a career in AI/ ML.</p>

The resource person was Dr. Shefali Arora, Assistant Professor, NIT Jalandhar. Dr. Arora discussed the domains of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science and Explainable AI. She introduced to the students the term “explainable AI” which provides reasons for the actions advocated by the algorithms. This adds to the confidence in using the predictions generated by the algorithms in making decisions and policy making. Students asked questions about synthetic datasets and their authenticity in training the algorithms for their projects.</p>
