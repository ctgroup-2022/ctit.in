            <p align="justify"> 
                CIVIL ENGINEERING is a PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, and railways.Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is the second-oldest engineering discipline after MILITARY ENGINEERING, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.

The Department offers a four-year course leading to the Bachelors Degree in Civil. Since its inception the Department has been imparting high quality education at Under graduate level . In total there are 30 students pursuing Bachelors degree in the department. The faculty of the department continues to strive loftier by exploring new frontiers of knowledge, imparting the latest technical knowledge to the students and conducting high quality of research. The faculty also renders technical advice on live engineering problems to various Government and Private Sector companies throughout the country.</p>
                <p align="justify">The academic activities of the Department emphasizes deep understanding of fundamental principles, development of creative ability to handle the challenges of Civil Engineering, and the analytical ability to solve problems which are interdisciplinary in nature. The Department also encourages its students to engage in extra-curricular and co-curricular activities, essential for development, nurturing of team spirit, and developing organizational skills.</p>
                <p align="justify">There is a lot of scope and opportunities for civil engineering students in the present and future as India is opening its purse strings for several infrastructural works more liberally than ever before. To be a part of making of new and developed India, we here at CTIT, Jalandhar, have taken every care and effort to impart quality education to our students by setting up ultra-modern laboratories, providing them latest software’s in civil engineering and best Teaching so that they remain at par. I extend my warm wishes to Civil Engineering students of the institute.</p>

Instead of using a preset equation as a model, machine learning algorithms "learn" information directly from data using computational techniques. As the amount of samples available for learning grows, the algorithms perform better and better in an adaptive manner. Two methods are used in machine learning: unsupervised learning, which looks for innate structures or hidden patterns in input data, and supervised learning, which trains a model using known input and output data to predict future outputs. The lab provides software, hardware and Internet resources to conduct these high end tasks for the knowledge and skills of the students.</p>

AI technology is increasing efficiency and performance in businesses by automating procedures or jobs that previously needed human labour. Additionally, AI is able to interpret data at a scale beyond human comprehension. That ability can yield significant business advantages. Repetitive learning and data-driven discovery are automated by AI. Artificial Intelligence handles repetitive, high-volume, digital activities rather than automating manual ones. And it does so without growing weary.

                            The lab focuses on conducting practical assignments related to cloud computing and virtualization. Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage. The term ‘cloud computing’ also refers to the technology that makes cloud work. This includes some form of virtualized IT infrastructure—servers, operating system software, networking, and other infrastructure that’s abstracted, using special software, so that it can be pooled and divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries. For example, a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers.

Heat Transfer Processes Are Encountered In A Large Number Of Engineering Applications. It Is Essential For Thermal Engineers To Understand The Principles Of Thermodynamics And Heat Transfer And Be Able To Employ The Rate Equations That Govern The Amount Of Energy Being Transferred. The Different Experiments In This Laboratory Enhance And Add Another Dimension To The Teaching/Learning Process Of The Subject Of Heat Transfer. One Of The Objectives Of This Heat Transfer Laboratory Is To Familiarize The Students With Different Experimental Methods, Techniques, And Devices That Can Be Employed To Study Heat Transfer Problems.
